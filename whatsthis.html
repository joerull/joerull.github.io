<div class="hero-override"><h1>what is this?</h1></div>
<div class="body-override"><p>this is a pretty basic jekyll site i'm using as an sandbox to work on whatever i feel like making in my free time. if i had to guess, i'd say i'm probably just gonna use this for testing out vague digital ideas i have for work, or as an outlet for occasional data content because sometimes i just miss writing about sports.</p></div>
